## Overview
A real estate listings website built with `python` `django` `javascript` `bootstrap`.

A simple, user-friendly and reponsive website developed using Python Django for the back-end, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for the front-end, and PostgresQL for a database.

I tried to carry out the project with a practical manner as I would if I were building this for a client.

The project consists of both a front-facing website and the admin area. 
On the homepage there is a large search box with some fields to allow the user to filter among featured listings.
The search functionality is asctually pretty simple: it shows how to build query sets and how to filter your data when you are fetching from the database.
The user can search by keyword, city, state, number of bedrooms, and price. The bedrooms and price filters are a less than or equal to filter.
The search results page has a form on the top to allow the user to keep on searching easily.
Below the search box, we have the latest listings section, where will be placed whaever are the latest listings in the database.
Finally, at the bottom of the page there is just some static markup with some services.

On the about page we have some about data and three realtors; these can be added in the admin area, and they will automatically be shown in this section. For each realtor we have their name, phone number and email.
On the right of the page there is a checkbox for seller of the month, which can be also chosen in the admin area, so whoever is seller of the month among the realtors will be automatically shown up right there.
So, we have some dyniamic data on the about page as well.

The featured listings page composes of several listings, which right now I have set to six per page. For each listing we have the main image, the price, and some other data. Clicking for more info takes us to the single listing page, where we have breadcrumbs, the title, at the top, the address, and the assigned realtor on the right of the page.
So, realtors and listings have a relationship so that on the listings page we can access any of that particular realtor's information that we want. The idea is that each realtor is assigned certain listings.
On the single listing page, below the main image we have some smaller images that open up in a lightbox. Lightbox 2 (https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) has been used for this.
At the bottom we have some data like the sqft, the loft size, the price, description. Below the assigned realtor we have a 'make an inquiry' button: clicking on it opens up a module, and if the user is already registered and logged in from the front-facing website, the name and email sections of the module will be auto-populated from the database from that user.

When registering for an account by filling all the required fields and then clicking on the register button, the user gets a little message. I have used Django messages for this, and formatted them with Bootstrap, and have also added a little bit of Javascript so the message disappears after three seconds.
I didn't want the user to be direclty logged in after registering, but being redirected to the login page instead. Logging in takes the user to a dashboard, that is basically just a list of any inquiries that they have made.

We are also going to have the following functionality: if the user sends an inquiry for a listing, they get a success message saying they'll get back
to them. If the user tries to make another request
on the same property, they're going to get an
error saying they've already made that
request.

As regards the admin side, if I log in with an admin user first of all you can see that I have customized the colors
to match the branding, and that I have added the logo on the top left-hand corner here if we go to this side
There is some standard Django functionality that's there by default. In addition to that, we have realtors, listings (which we can also choose to unpublish by unchecking and saving, and then going back to the front-facing website) and contacts, where any inquiries that are made will be
put.
So, we can publish and unpublish really easily.


### Python version (Recommended):	3.8 Version 
Python 3.8 introduces some new syntax to the language, as well as a few small modifications to existing behavior and, most importantly, a slew of performance improvements, following in the footsteps of the previous 3.7 version.

### Programming Language Used:	Python Django Language
Django is a high-level Python web framework for building safe and maintainable websites quickly. Django is a web framework built by experienced developers that takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting so you can focus on developing your app instead of reinventing the wheel.

### Project Type:	Web Application
A web application, unlike computer-based software programs that operate locally on the deviceâ€™s operating system, is application software that runs on a web server. The user uses a web browser with an active network connection to access web apps.

### Database : PostgreSQL
(https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Surface

* Colours

The colour scheme was chosen based on the background image I wanted to use sitewide:
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate a colour palette based on the image.

## **Manual Testing**

### Manual Testing of User Input and Functions

  I systematically tested all user inputs and functionality in the website to compare feedback/results against expected results.  
  Any unexpected output/outcomes were fixed.  
  
### Desktop
  
  Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox: All aspects of the site work perfectly fine. Pages load quickly, all features are working and found no problems with CRUD, registering and logging in or out, submitting inquiries, etc.

  * Every button works and redirects to the next page quickly<br>
  * Url's load correctly on both the About page and the Featured Listings page<br>
  * (Deactivated function) Sign up form sends an automated email from a gmail account to the user to verify the email address; this works as it should.  

### Mobile

  Tested all aspects of the site via three devices, Apple Iphone 11, Samsung S20 and Samsung S7 tablet. The site reacts well to different devices, responsiveness works well, including on Apple's browser Safari.



## Deployment


<details>
<summary>Heroku Deployment Steps: </summary>

 1. Ensure all dependencies are listed within the requirements.txt file

 Within the terminal in Gitpod type `pip3 --local freeze > requirements.txt`, and a list with all requirements will be created to be read by Heroku.

 2. Setting up Heroku
  * NB Due to security issues connecting github directly to heroku (at the time this project was deployed),
    first you must log into your heroku account via the terminal in gitpod (more info on this further down).  
    2.1 Next, navigate to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website
    2.2 Login to Heroku
    2.3 Click on `New` (top right) and Create a new app    
    2.4 Choose a project name and set your location
    2.5. Navigate to the `Resources` tab
    2.6. In the `Add ons` section, search for Heroku Postgres and select it on the list
      - A pop up will appear, select, 'Hobby Dev' and click `Submit order form`    
    2.7.1. Next, You would usually navigate to the `deploy` tab;
      - Click on connect to Github
      - Search for the repository named Metal-Re-Injection
      - And connect heroku to Github.<br>
    2.7.2. But, as mentioned above this is not possible for the time being.
      - So instead, In order to connect gitpod to heroku type:
          - `$ heroku login -i`
          - Then enter your heroku credentials,
          - Now you are logged into heroku in Gitpod
          - Once all code is commited and pushed to Github, simply push code from Gitpod to heroku using the command:<br>
          - Heroku will start the build process, this can be viewed under the `Activity` tab<br>
          - Once the build process has completed, navigate to `Open App`
          - The app should now be ready to view
    2.8. Navigate to the settings tab
    2.9.  Click on Config Vars, and add Cloudinary, Database URL (from Heroku-Postgres) and Secret key

</details>

<details>
<summary>Forking the GitHub Repository </summary>

* By forking the GitHub Repository, you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account, allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

    - Log in to your own GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository you wish to fork
    - At the top of the Repository (not top of page), just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
    - You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

* Making a Local Clone

    - Log in to your own GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
    - Under the repository name, click "Clone or download"
    - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
    - Open Git Bash
    - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
    - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3

 $ git clone https://github.com/Yari-Carelli/Real-Estate-Project

Press Enter. Your local clone will be created
