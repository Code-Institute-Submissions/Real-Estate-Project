## <h1 align=center>Real Estate Project</h1>


<br>

#
[Here is a link to the final project](https://real-estate-project-yc.herokuapp.com/)
#

A real estate listings website built with `python` `django` `bootstrap`.

A simple, reponsive  website developed using Python Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

# Python version (Recommended):	3.8 Version
Python 3.8 introduces some new syntax to the language, as well as a few small modifications to existing behavior and, most importantly, a slew of performance improvements, following in the footsteps of the previous 3.7 version.

# Programming Language Used:	Python Django Language
Django is a high-level Python web framework for building safe and maintainable websites quickly. Django is a web framework built by experienced developers that takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting so you can focus on developing your app instead of reinventing the wheel.

# Project Type:	Web Application
A web application, unlike computer-based software programs that operate locally on the deviceâ€™s operating system, is application software that runs on a web server. The user uses a web browser with an active network connection to access web apps.

# Database : PostgresSQL
(https://www.postgresql.org/)

### 1. Strategy

  + **Project Goal**


### 2. Scope

 * A simple, straightforward, intuitive UX experience

### 5. Surface

* Colours

- The colour scheme was chosen based on the background image I wanted to use sitewide:
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate a colour palette based on the image.

## **Manual Testing**

### Manual Testing of User Input and Functions

  I systematically tested all user inputs and functionality in the website to compare feedback/results against expected results.  
  Any unexpected output/outcomes were fixed.  
  
### Desktop
  
  Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox: All aspects of the site work perfectly fine. Pages load quickly, all features are working and found no problems with CRUD, registering and logging in or out, submitting inquiries, etc.

  * Every button works and redirects to the next page quickly<br>
  * Url's load correctly on both the About page and the Featured Listings page<br>
  * (Deactivated function) Sign up form sends an automated email from a gmail account to the user to verify the email address; this works as it should.  

### Mobile

  Tested all aspects of the site via three devices, Apple Iphone 11, Samsung S20 and Samsung S7 tablet. The site reacts well to different devices, responsiveness works well, including on Apple's browser Safari.



## Deployment


<details>
<summary>Heroku Deployment Steps: </summary>

 1. Ensure all dependencies are listed within the requirements.txt file

 Within the terminal in Gitpod type `pip3 --local freeze > requirements.txt`, and a list with all requirements will be created to be read by Heroku.

 2. Setting up Heroku
  * NB Due to security issues connecting github directly to heroku (at the time this project was deployed),
    first you must log into your heroku account via the terminal in gitpod (more info on this further down).  
    2.1 Next, navigate to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website
    2.2 Login to Heroku
    2.3 Click on `New` (top right) and Create a new app    
    2.4 Choose a project name and set your location
    2.5. Navigate to the `Resources` tab
    2.6. In the `Add ons` section, search for Heroku Postgres and select it on the list
      - A pop up will appear, select, 'Hobby Dev' and click `Submit order form`    
    2.7.1. Next, You would usually navigate to the `deploy` tab;
      - Click on connect to Github
      - Search for the repository named Metal-Re-Injection
      - And connect heroku to Github.<br>
    2.7.2. But, as mentioned above this is not possible for the time being.
      - So instead, In order to connect gitpod to heroku type:
          - `$ heroku login -i`
          - Then enter your heroku credentials,
          - Now you are logged into heroku in Gitpod
          - Once all code is commited and pushed to Github, simply push code from Gitpod to heroku using the command:<br>
          - Heroku will start the build process, this can be viewed under the `Activity` tab<br>
          - Once the build process has completed, navigate to `Open App`
          - The app should now be ready to view
    2.8. Navigate to the settings tab
    2.9.  Click on Config Vars, and add Cloudinary, Database URL (from Heroku-Postgres) and Secret key

</details>

<details>
<summary>Forking the GitHub Repository </summary>

* By forking the GitHub Repository, you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account, allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

    - Log in to your own GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository you wish to fork
    - At the top of the Repository (not top of page), just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
    - You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

* Making a Local Clone

    - Log in to your own GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
    - Under the repository name, click "Clone or download"
    - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
    - Open Git Bash
    - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
    - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3

 $ git clone https://github.com/Yari-Carelli/Real-Estate-Project

Press Enter. Your local clone will be created

5. **Run Server**

```sh
python manage.py runserver 
```
